# In our last in-class lab, we wrote code to rank zip codes based on the median income in a county and how many pills per person the county received from 2006-2012. At the end of the lab, I ran the data for all of the counties in the country. Right now, I am going to run the data for the individual towns within Anne Arundel County. I've looked at the rankings before, but now I will visualize them.

# This is from lab_O7. I requested my own key from the census: 

key <- "uO4EK6I"

census_api_key("366af81ca42273ae67ad0729766f54f041bd300d")


# The following graf is from lab_07:

# Store a table with the median household income value for each county using the get_acs() function.  ACS is short for American Community Survey, one of two main census products. In the table that's loaded in, the :estimate" is the median household income for that county, averaged over 5 years ending in 2006. 

county_median_household_income <- get_acs(geography = "county", variables = c("B19013_001"), survey="acs5", year = 2012)

# How did I get the variables? I pulled in a table from the tidycensus package that lists all of the thousands of variables available through the census. Load the table below and view it.  Use filters in the R Viewer window to find things you might want to use later. You can also find table and variable numbers at https://data.census.gov/cedsci/.
